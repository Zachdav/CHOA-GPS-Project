\section*{Comments}
	\paragraph*{}
		Everything in the project is comming together. We are definitely on schedule, but still have plenty of work to do to make sure that all of these components work together and everything is in a complete and presentable clean looking package for the showcase. On top of all the project work we needed to start allocating time to work on the presentation side of the showcase with out abstract report and poster as well.
