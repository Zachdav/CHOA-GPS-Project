We need to have a GUI for iOS as our clients requested so that all the nurses, doctors, and other hospital staff can use the in door tracking. We spent the last two weeks laying out the layers and frames required. We are includeing a map with pinpoints for each and every tracked device and more device details if clicked. We also are including a page with a list of all the devices currently being tracked.  We need to contact our clients to ask for there map resource elements that they use on their app for the visitors.\\

\section*{Comments}
	\paragraph*{}
		This week was all about the app development and the software on the front and back end. Waiting on the hardware this week ended up being a good thing so we could catch up on the work that needed and needs to be done on the tracking and information in the application.
