		October 3rd, 2017 & 2 & Alex created a google doc for the group to begin working on the
		midterm report.  The work was split rather evenly and I contributed to the background research and preliminary design portion of the report.  After completion and review this
		was submitted.\\

		October 3rd, 2017 & Under 1 & I also created and initialized a private GitHub Repository 
		for the group to create and version controlle code when we began developing the software.  
		This was later deleted and re-created by Alex later on because of permission issues.\\

		October 4th, 2017 & Under 1 & Alex created a google calendar to help organize and optimize
		or time working together.\\

		October 9th - 10th, 2017 & 4 & Created an submitted a presentation for our midterm 
		presentation on Wednesday.  I spent most of my time on the problem constraints, mentor and 
		client feedback, as well as existing product.  Having completed the presentation Dr. 
		Johnsen mentioned that across the board our contraints from our client were not well 
		outlined.  I intend to fix this.  More on this in my notebook.\\

		October 12th, 2017 & 2 & Began parsing an existing location project on GitHub using a 
		raspberry pi to determine what we like about this project and what we do not.  Although
		this may help us with the portion of the project involving location much more will need 
		to be added to determine machine state and display in a UI.\\

\section*{Comments}
	\paragraph*{}
		This last week was all about gathering together and organizing what it is we have done so 
		far and ironing out an exact plan about what we plan on doing for the rest of the semester 
		in the effort of completing our project.  As a group the presentation did not go as well as
		planned in my opinion, but that does not change where we stand on the project, which I 
		believe is better than we were able to present.  One last comment on the last project
		in feedback you mentioned that it was absurb that I claimed that the hours were 16.  I
		believe that i misunderstood the format.  I thought that it was supposed to be total hours
		up until the date the report was turned in.  That all meaning progress report two 
		encompassed 8 hours not 16.  Sorry for the confusion.
