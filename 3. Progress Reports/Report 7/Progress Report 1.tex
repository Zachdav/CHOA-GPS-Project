\section*{Comments}
	\paragraph*{}
		This week was all about getting back on track after our long holiday break. The first thing that I needed to do for the group was email Roger Hilton to ask about a budget adjustment. The last few things that we did last semester was determine that bluetooth and WiFi triangulation would not work for our needs and this meant we need an entirely new solution. THis landed us on UltraWideBand technology, which shares the benefits of both Bluetooth and WiFi. This of course means that we would need new hardware, which led to a massive change in the needed budget.  Alex and Brian started the semester by updating and touching base with our mentor Dr. Wen Zhen Song while i worked out the budget and list of required hardware for the new design.
